# PDF to Audiobook
Convert PDF to Speech - A Python script that uses PyPDF2 library to extract text from a PDF file and pyttsx3 library to convert that text into speech. 
The script provides an easy-to-use command line interface for converting a PDF file to speech. Once the script is executed, the user is prompted to enter the path to the PDF file and then select the voice and speed of speech. The script then converts the text from the PDF file to speech and plays it through the speakers.
